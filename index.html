        <br>
        <p>Hi there!<br>
           
            <br>
            I am thrilled that u find ur way to my website!<br>
           <br>
            <strong>So who am I?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Well, little me arrived on earth on the second of august 2002, through an emergency cesarean section, extremely eager for what is to come.<br>
            I was born and raised in a small town outside Bor√•s. It was me, my little sister Iza, mom and dad,<br>
            we also lived extremely near my grandparents,like walking distance near, it was wonderful!!<br>
            I LOVE cats, we have always had a cat, and these past years we've had two rescue cats that were born on my parent's wedding day!!:)<br>
            I have always struggled with poor mental health that has become worse with the years,<br>
            and I am currently waiting right now to do an ADHD basic investigation, to see if that can be the problem!<br>
            <br>
            I recently moved to J√∂nk√∂ping, as you may figure. <br>
            Right now I share an apartment with two other guys, but since that is not ideal I decided to move!<br> 
            November first will FINALLY be the day when I can feel comfortable in my own home!<br>
            I'm not going to lie, it has been a challenge to move away from home.<br>
            I miss my sister and my cats so much, it is semi-hard to live and be financially stable just from CSN,<br>
            but at least I like what I'm doing!</p>
        
        <h2>Why am I studying NMD?</h2>
        <p>Well, I did not think I had good enough grades to end up here. But I did and I am really glad!<br> 
            I studied art for three years in high school (gymnasiet) and absolutely fell in love with adobes programs and art history.<br>
            After graduating I worked for a year and did not know what I wanted to be.<br> 
            I then found this program and saw that some courses had some of the things I liked and was interested in,<br>
            but many new things as well, so I took the chance, to try it out and I feel "at home" it feels like I choose the right thing to do.<br>
            In the future I would love to work with fashion magazines, plan their layout, and so on!</p>
    
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy going to the gym, to get the energy out but also to see the changes as I get stronger plus I REALLY want a bag from nordic wellness.<br>
            I like being creative as well, right now I'm crocheting a sweater.<br>
            I sometimes paint, play guitar, braid bracelets, and so forth.<br> 
            I love to meet my sisters, my friends, and my boyfriend.</p>
