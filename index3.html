<h1>Reasons why you should visit J√∂nk√∂ping</h1>
 <p>There are many reasons as to why you should visit J√∂nk√∂ping.<br>
    All from the shopping to the close to nature tourist attractions.<br>
    Some of the items I will list below are more enjoyable to do during the spring/summer.<br> 
    But I am sure you will find something that suits you as well!<br>
</p>
<h2> My top three picks off things to do in J√∂nk√∂ping: </h2>  

<ol>
    <br>
<li>First I would visit the Rosenlunds Rosarium, it is a park filled with flowers.<br>
    It is near the city centre so u can walk along V√§ttern to find the rosarium.<br> 
    It is an amazing place to have a picnic, read a book or just hang with friends and family. </li>
<br>
<li> Do you enjoy shopping? Then Asecs is the place to go!!<br>
    It offers 90 different shops, food from all of the continents, clothes, books and so on!<br>
    Even if you do not have a car it is very easy to get there, just a 10 minute bus ride away! </li>
<br>
<li> Stadsparken, a very popular place for family with kids. A review from 2020 said: ‚ÄúStadsparken is perfect place for all family.<br>
    There are big playground for children, mini golf, bird museum, little zoo, restaurant, place for picnic.<br>
    Park near city center, you can get there with city bus it takes about 10 min from central station or with car, there are parking nearby.<br>
    From park you can get amazing panoramic view of city! Definitely recommend to everyone!‚Äù<br></li>
</ol> 

<h2>Places to go out</h2>
   <p> If you are a student Akademin, which is a nightclub (only for students) is open every Wednesday.<br>
      It‚Äôs very popular amongst the students on Ju, they wear their overall and party all night long!<br>
      <br>
      If you are NOT a student. The best places to go is probably Shooters or H√∂rnan.<br>
      Shooters is a bar where you can play 8 ball pool and shuffleboards in the basement. Next to Shooters is H√∂rnan which is a karaoke bar, very fun!!<br>
</p>
<h2>Good places to eat </h2>
<p>
Well as I myself am a student there will not be any fancy restaurant placed in this chategory.<br>
Do you want hamburgers? Then you can either go to Burger King which is in the city (idk who would eat there thoüëÄ).<br>
If you would like to go to a more ‚Äúfancy‚Äù burger place then Bada Bing Burger or Bastard Burgers, which ironically is placed almost next to each other are a good choice.<br> 
<br>
Apparently you can find Swedens best Kebab-sauce in one of the restaurants, Alcamo pizza.<br>
<br>
I love asian food and my go to right now is Chop-Chop which is near Asecs, aisain fast food to reasonable prices but extremely tasty!!<br>
